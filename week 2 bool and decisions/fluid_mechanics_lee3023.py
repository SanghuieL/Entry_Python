Assignment: 2.5 - Fluid Mechanics

Description:
    This program will find the reynold's number for water flow through a pipe given user parameters.
    It will ask for the velocity of water, diameter of the pipe and a water temperature from 3 options. 
    Using the equation Re = Vd/v, we will calculate the number.

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
